Description: The events package manipulates, aggregates and 
             otherwise messes with event data from 'KEDS' and 
             'TABARI' software and those with similar output. It also 
             bundles several classic event data sets. Most
             functions are superseded by those in 'dplyr' and 'tidyr'.
